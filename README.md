## Summary

This is a demo project I wanted to include here as part of my portfolio of Skills. This particular project is written in Javascript using the NextJS framework. As data source I'm using a free node in Atlas Mongo DB and Cloudinary as a photo bucket. Plus, I make use of the OAuth and geolocation services provided by Google. Credits to my teacher Brad Traversy for the formation. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
