## Summary

This paragraph describes a demonstration project that I have chosen to feature in my professional portfolio, which showcases a diverse range of my technical abilities. Specifically, this project utilizes the NextJS framework, a popular choice for developing server-rendered React applications, and is written in JavaScript. For storing data, I opted to use Atlas MongoDB, availing of their complimentary tier to manage the database needs efficiently. Additionally, I employed Cloudinary for managing and storing images, which serves as an effective solution for handling media files in web applications. To enhance user interaction and functionality, the project incorporates Google's OAuth for authentication processes and geolocation services to show tailor made maps based on addreses. I extend my gratitude to my mentor, Brad Traversy, whose guidance was instrumental in my learning and development throughout this project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
